__Topic:__ Testing hypotheses to increase revenue in an online store. Evaluating the results of the A/B test

__Purpose:__ 
Prioritize a list of hypotheses to increase revenue.
Analyze the results of the A / B test
1. Draw conclusions from the graphs of cumulative revenue, average receipt, and their relative changes
2. Determine the boundary of abnormal quantities and costs of orders.
3. Calculate the statistical significance of the differences, make conclusions and assumptions based on" raw "and" purified "data 
4. Test hypotheses about the presence of differences between the average receipts and conversions of groups" B "and" A".
5. Make and justify a decision based on the test results.

__Stack:__

__Conclusion:__ There is a statistically significant difference in the conversion rate between the groups both according to raw data and after filtering out anomalies.
There is no statistically significant difference in the average check.
It is proposed to stop the test, fix the victory of group B by conversion

__Skills and tools:__ 

__Project status:__ Completed.
