__Topic:__ Testing hypotheses to increase revenue in an online store. Evaluating the results of the AB test

__Purpose:__ 

__Stack:__
Prioritize a list of hypotheses to increase revenue:
- Apply the ICE and RICE framework to prioritize hypotheses.
- Consider changes in the prioritization of hypotheses when using RICE instead of ICE.
Analyze the results of the A / B test:
1. Build a graph, make conclusions and assumptions:
- cumulative revenue by group.
- cumulative average check by group;
- the relative change in the cumulative average check of group B to group A;
- cumulative conversion by group;
- the relative change in the cumulative conversion of group B to group A.
2. Build dot graphs, make conclusions and assumptions, determine the boundary of anomalous:
- the number of orders by user;
- the cost of orders.
3. Calculate the statistical significance of the differences, make conclusions and assumptions:
- in the conversion between groups for "raw" and "purified" data;
- in the average order receipt between groups for "raw" and "cleaned" data. 
4. Test hypotheses about the presence of differences between the average receipts and conversions of groups "B" and " A "
5. Make and justify a decision based on the test results.
