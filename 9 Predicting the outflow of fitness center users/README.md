__Topic:__ Predicting the outflow of fitness center users.

__Purpose:__ 
1. The forecast of the probability of outflow (at the level of the next month) for each client.
2. To analyze the main signs that most strongly affect the outflow.
3. Develop recommendations for improving the quality of work with clients.

__Stack:__ 
1. A research analysis of the data was carried out
2. Pre-processing of data
- Selection of features
- Working with emissions
- Standardization of data.
3. The forecast of the probability of outflow (at the level of the next month) for each client is calculated. Using the binary classification model of clients.
4. Using the client clustering method, typical user portraits are formed, the most striking groups are highlighted, and their main properties are characterized.
5. The main signs that most strongly affect the outflow are analyzed. Recommendations are made to improve the quality of work with clients.

__Conclusion:__ 
Clusters with a higher share of outflow have the following characteristics: total revenue from other fitness center services; the average frequency of visits per week for the entire time; the fact of initial registration within the framework of the "bring a friend" campaign; the average frequency of visits per week for the previous month; the time since the first visit to the fitness center; the age of customers; the fact of attending group classes is less than in clusters with a lower share of outflow.
Based on this, we can offer the following recommendations for the strategy of interaction with customers and their retention:
- continue the "bring a friend" campaign, it is desirable to increase discounts at the same time;
- to develop the practice of conducting group classes (it is possible to conduct several introductory, free group classes to attract clients to this form of classes);
- let's consider the question of increasing the frequency of group classes;
- expand the range of other fitness center services

__Skills and tools:__ Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, machine learning, classification clustering

__Project status:__ Completed.
