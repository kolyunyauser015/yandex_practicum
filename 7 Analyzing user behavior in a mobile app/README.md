3. Checking the data by time
4. Studying the event funnel
- Study of the sequence of events
- Analysis of the event funnel
5. Analysis of the results of A/A/B experiment 
6. Hypothesis testing-about the presence of a statistical difference between the shares of users in the control groups; - about the presence of statistical differences in all events between the share of users in the group with the changed font and the share of users in the control groups
7. General conclusion
