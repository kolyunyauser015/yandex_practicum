__Topic:__ Analyzing user behavior in a mobile app

__Purpose:__ 
Based on the analysis, understand how the users of the mobile application behave:
1. Examine and check the data:
- how many events and users are there in the log?
- how many events are there on average per user?
determine from what moment the data is complete. Discarding the old data, determine the degree of loss of events and users, check for the presence of users in all experimental groups.
Study the sales funnel, find out how users reach the purchase. How many users reach the purchase, and how many are "stuck" on the previous steps and on which ones exactly?
Investigate the results of an A / A/B experiment to change the font throughout the application To find out which font is better. Check the accuracy of the conducted testing.
Understand how much time and data will be required for further tests.
