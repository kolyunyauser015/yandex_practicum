__Topic:__ Analyzing user behavior in a mobile app

__Purpose:__ 
Based on the analysis, we can understand how users of the mobile application behave.
Study the sales funnel, find out how users reach the purchase.
Investigate the results of an A/A/B experiment to change the font throughout the application. Check the accuracy of the conducted testing.

__Stack:__
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Determining the number of events, unique users and the average number of events per user
3. Checking the data by time
4. Studying the event funnel
- Study of the sequence of events
- Analysis of the event funnel
5. Analysis of the results of A/A/B experiment 
6. Hypothesis testing-about the presence of a statistical difference between the shares of users in the control groups; - about the presence of statistical differences in all events between the share of users in the group with the changed font and the share of users in the control groups
7. General conclusion

__Conclusion:__ 
There is no statistical difference between the shares of users in the control groups for all events - the division into groups works correctly.
There are no statistical differences for all events between the share of users in the group with the changed font and the share of users in each control group, as well as the share of users in the combined control group.
Therefore, changing the font does not affect the conversion of users.
When testing hypotheses, a significance level of 0.05 (5%) was chosen, which allows us to exclude errors of the first kind.

__Skills and tools:__ A / Btesting, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, event analytics, product metrics, Plotly, testing statistical hypotheses, data visualization.

__Project status:__ Completed.
