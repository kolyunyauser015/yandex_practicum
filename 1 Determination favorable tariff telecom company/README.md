__Topic:__ Determining a promising tariff for a telecom company

__Purpose:__ To analyze customer behavior and search for the optimal tariff based on the mobile operator's customer data.

__Stack:__
1. Open data files and explore general information
2. Data preprocessing
- converting data to the required types;
- replacing omissions with values;
- delete columns that are not needed in the study;
- changing column names.
3. Error correction (zero-duration calls)
4. Calculations and adding data
- the number of calls made and minutes of conversation spent, the number of messages sent, and the amount of Internet traffic consumed by month;
- monthly revenue from each user;
5. Tariff analysis
- description of the operator's customer behavior based on the sample;
- calculation of the number of minutes of conversation, messages, and Internet traffic volume for each tariff per month;
- calculation of the average quantity, variance and standard deviation;
- building histograms;
- analysis of the distribution.
6. Hypothesis testing:
- the average revenue of users of the "Ultra" and "Smart" tariffs differ;
- the average revenue of users from Moscow differs from that of users from other regions.
7. General conclusion

__Conclusion:__ Based on the results of the analysis, it can be argued that the "Ultra" tariff is better than the tariff. The hypothesis that the average revenue of users of the "Ultra" and "Smart" tariffs is different is not rejected. The hypothesis that the revenue of users from Moscow differs from the revenue of users from other regions is rejected.

Skills and tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, descriptive statistics, statistical hypothesis testing.
