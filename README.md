# yandex_practicum
The repository contains the main projects for the profession of data analyst, which I completed during training courses at [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/data-analyst/) It is presented in the form of IPython notebooks and readme files.

## __List of projects__

|__Project name__|__Description__|__Skills and tools__|
|----------------|---------------|--------------------|
|Determining the best tariff for a telecom company|The data was preprocessed. The analysis of the use of tariffs on a sample of customers, the behavior of customers when using the operator's services is carried out. The hypothesis of the difference in the revenue of subscribers of different tariffs was tested. The hypothesis about the difference in the revenue of subscribers from Moscow and other regions was tested. Based on the results of the analysis, a conclusion was made â€” which tariff is better.|Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, descriptive statistics, testing statistical hypotheses|
|Study of patterns that determine the success of games|The parameters that determine the success of the game in different regions of the world are identified. On based on this, a report has been prepared for the computer game store for planning purposes ad campaigns. Data preprocessing and analysis were performed. Current status is selected period for analysis. User profiles for each region have been compiled. Checked hypotheses: average user ratings for the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same; the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. In the analysis, I used the Student's criterion for independent samples|Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, data preprocessing, research data analysis, descriptive statistics, testing statistical hypotheses|
|Airline data research|The data provided by the airline was uploaded and prepared using SQL tools. The hypothesis about the difference in the average demand for tickets during various festivals and at normal times is tested.|SQL, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, testing statistical hypotheses|
|Optimize your marketing expenses in Yandex. Afisha|We analyzed data from Yandex. Afisha to optimize marketing costs. Calculated metrics LTV, CAC, Retention rate, DAU, WAU, MAU, ROMI|Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, cohort analysis, uniteconomics, product metrics|
|Testing hypotheses to increase revenue in an online store. Evaluating the results of the A/B test|Hypotheses were prioritized using the ICE and RICE frameworks. Then the results of the A/B test were analyzed. Graphs of cumulative revenue, average receipt, and conversions by groups were plotted. The statistical significance of the differences in conversions and average receipts for raw and purified data was calculated. Based on the analysis, a decision was made that it is inappropriate to continue conducting the test.|Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, A / Btesting, testing statistical hypotheses. 
|Research of the public catering market in Moscow for making a decision about opening a new cafe|The question of whether a cafe will be successful and popular for a long time is investigated. where guests are served by robot waiters. Based on the results of the analysis prepared by presentation for investors with recommendations. In the construction of graphs, the following methods are used: seaborn and plotly libraries. A study of the location areas was conducted competitor cafes. This is why we connected to the Yandex.Geocoder API, and also used the Mosgaz website to download data.|Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, data visualization|
|Analyzing user behavior in a mobile app.|This project examines the principles of event analytics. Built sales funnel. Investigated the users ' path to purchase. Analyzed it results of the A / B test for introducing new fonts. Compared 2 control groups between. I made sure that the traffic was divided correctly, and then compared it with the test group. It was found that the new font will not significantly affect user behavior.|A / Btesting, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, event analytics, product metrics, Plotly, testing statistical hypotheses, data visualization|
|Creating a dashboard based on custom events.|I worked on this project on a remote machine in the Yandex. Cloud service. By me PostgreSQL was installed and the database was deployed. Then I wrote the pipeline script, which allowed collecting data for a specific time period, and configured it offline operation via crontab. To visualize the collected data, I wrote a script. I created a dashboard with multiple filters and also ran it on a remote machine. By the results were presented in a presentation with the resulting graphs.|Python, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, dash, Tableau, product metrics, building dashboards|
