|Determining the best tariff for a telecom company|The data was preprocessed. The analysis of the use of tariffs on a sample of customers, the behavior of customers when using the operator's services is carried out. The hypothesis of the difference in the revenue of subscribers of different tariffs was tested. The hypothesis about the difference in the revenue of subscribers from Moscow and other regions was tested. Based on the results of the analysis, a conclusion was made â€” which tariff is better.|Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, descriptive statistics, testing statistical hypotheses|
|Study of patterns that determine the success of games|The parameters that determine the success of the game in different regions of the world are identified. On based on this, a report has been prepared for the computer game store for planning purposes ad campaigns. Data preprocessing and analysis were performed. Current status is selected period for analysis. User profiles for each region have been compiled. Checked hypotheses: average user ratings for the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same; the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. In the analysis, I used the Student's criterion for independent samples|Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, data preprocessing, research data analysis, descriptive statistics, testing statistical hypotheses|
|Airline data research|The data provided by the airline was uploaded and prepared using SQL tools. The hypothesis about the difference in the average demand for tickets during various festivals and at normal times is tested.|SQL, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, testing statistical hypotheses|
