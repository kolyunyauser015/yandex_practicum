- the cost of attracting one buyer from each source;
- how much did the expenses pay off.

Give marketers recommendations on which traffic sources should be focused on. Identify the most promising cohorts of clients for the company.

__Stack:__

__Conclusion:__ 
The largest return on marketing investment is accounted for by 1 source, then 5 and 2. At the same time, the highest cost of attracting a client is accounted for by 3 and 2 sources. It is proposed to redistribute the marketing costs of 3 sources in the interests of 1 and 5 sources.
The low Retention Rate shows that users do not stay on the site, therefore, marketing companies are more focused on attracting new customers, rather than on retaining old ones.
It is proposed to change the priorities in the future and direct the marketing company to old customers.
Cohort analysis showed that the most promising cohorts for the company are the cohorts of September, December, June, July, August.
