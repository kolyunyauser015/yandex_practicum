__Topic:__ Analysis of passenger air transportation.

__Purpose:__ Conduct an analysis of the dependence: 
- aircraft models and the number of flights; 
- cities and number of flights.
To test the hypothesis about the difference in the average demand for tickets during various festivals and at normal times

__Stack:__


__Conclusion:__ The hypothesis about the difference in the average demand for tickets during various festivals and at normal times was not confirmed. During festivals, the demand practically does not change - just look at the ticket_amount column of the combined table and compare the values.
The number of flights depends on:
1. the class of the airport - the higher the class, the more flights
2. depending on the number of airports in the city - the more airports in the city, the more flights there are naturally
3. depending on the model of the aircraft-aircraft designed for long-distance flights make fewer flights, naturally they are in flight for more time, they need more time to prepare for the flight. During this time, small aircraft can make several flights.

__Skills and tools:__ Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, data preprocessing, research data analysis, descriptive statistics, testing statistical hypotheses.

__Project status:__ Completed.
